**Key observations:**
- Metal tile roof (appears to be "Magma" brand)
- Wooden structural beams at eave level
- Suspended ceiling hung below beams
- No visible insulation between roof and ceiling
- Clean structural framework suitable for cathedral ceiling conversion

## Materials

### Ceiling Paint

![TOA 4 Seasons Paint](paint.png)
**TOA 4 Seasons AdNance** - 100% acrylic emulsion paint for ceiling application. Super matt finish. This paint will be used for the new insulated cathedral ceiling.

## Design Inspiration

### Cathedral Ceiling Reference

![Cathedral Ceiling Vision](vision.png)
**Design inspiration** - Modern cathedral ceiling with skylights and loft area. Shows the desired aesthetic for the renovation: bright white vaulted ceiling following the roof slope, skylights for natural light, and open plan living space with maximum ceiling height.

**Design goals based on this inspiration:**
- Cathedral ceiling following roof slope
- Insulated ceiling attached to roof underside
- Bright white finish for maximum light reflection
- Open plan living space
- Maximum vertical volume utilization
