# server for users

the tools are thre

we need to alow users to do what we do in vscode now.

a very basic GUI that uses datastar to:

allow users to call claude and see the out put from claude just like using it in vscode.  this is a simple chat gui using datastar.

allow users to see the drawings folder as a tree.
whjen each svg or readme changes on the FS, the web gui updates. Datastar is create for this.
